# Release Notes

## Version 1.0.0 - 2025-05-01

### üöÄ Features
- Implement `ImageClassifierManager` using TensorFlow Lite Micro
- Add `SystemTasksManager::image3dCapturerTask` for coordinated image capture
- Implement new `PsCanController` abstraction layer with flexible baudrate support
- Rework I2C communication logic to polling-based for increased stability
- Introduce `MsgGateway` component to decouple data flow
- Enable CBOR encoding for structured sensor data transmission
- Upgrade timestamp fields to 64-bit to support longer runtimes
- Add TensorFlow Lite Micro library integration

### üõ†Ô∏è Improvements
- Refactor `CanController`: remove blocking loops, add mutex in RX/TX
- Improve Lidar measurement accuracy and configuration
- Reduce communication task latency
- Cleanup redundant test headers and simplify `main.cpp`
- Add mutex to `Logger` for thread safety

### üêõ Fixes
- Fix bug in Lidar distance measurement
- Prevent I2C communication deadlocks
- Resolve race conditions in Logger and communication subsystems
- Correct uninitialized pointer in `TimeBaseManager`

## Version 0.2.0 - 2024-12-12

### Feature
- Release v0.2.0 includes:
  - `SystemTasksManager::communicationTask` working.
